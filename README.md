This is one of my (hopefully not the only one) personal projects as a freshman in college. It ain't much, but it is honest work.

Its made entirely out of ASCII characters and some colors poured within.
At this point in time, I didn't know how to use GUI assets, let alone using multiple files for the game. (As in different sounds for different actions/outcomes)
I'll let this be a stepping stone for my career/journey.
